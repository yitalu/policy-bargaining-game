This is a recruitment message about an opportunity to earn extra credits in your course. You have to **REGISTER** beforehand to be able to participate in the study. Read the below sections for details.

### Real-time Study
This is a **REAL-TIME INTERACTIVE** online study, which is different from other studies you might have taken for extra credit in other classes. You will be paired with other participants and interact with them. Therefore, **BEING ON TIME** and **FINISHING** the study are the requisites for getting extra credit. You will NOT get extra credit if you are late or leave the study in the midway. 

### Amount of Extra Credit
You will earn extra credit at 1% of the final course grade for showing up online **ON TIME** and **FINISHING** the experiment. You can receive additional extra credit up to 1% of the course grade based on the decisions you and other participants make in the study.

### Qualification
You have to be 18 years old or over to participate. We will ask a question about your age in the study. You should also be an English speaker to participate as all instructions in the study will only be available in English. For people who are under 18 and want to earn extra credit, see the Alternative Task section.

### Dates and Times:
There are three other experiment sessions you can choose from. Each person can participate in ONLY ONE session (even if you received this recruitment message from multiple classes you take), so choose the course you want to earn extra credit for when you register.
