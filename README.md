This is a recruitment message about an opportunity for earning extra credits in your course. You have to REGISTER beforehand to be able to participate in the study. Read below sections for details.

### Real-time Experiment
This is a REAL-TIME INTERACTIVE online study, which is different from other studies you might have taken for extra credit in other classes. You will be paired with other participants and interact with them. Therefore, BEING ON TIME and FOCUSING during the study session are the requisites for getting extra credit. You will not get extra credit if you are late or leave the study in the midway. 

### Amount of Extra Credit
You will earn extra credit at 1% of the final course grade for showing up online ON TIME and FINISHING the experiment. You can receive additional extra credit up to 1% of the course grade based on the decisions you and other participants make in the study. The participation is completely voluntary.

### Qualification
You have to be 18 years old or over and to participate. We will ask a question about your age in the study. Also, you should be an English speaker to participate as all instructions in the study will only be available in English.

### Dates and Times of Study:
